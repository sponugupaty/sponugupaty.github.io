{:toc}

## Basic setup

- Amazon looks for a combination of functional and leadership skills 
- Not much is consistent across groups at Amazon and hence they are guided by leadership principles
- Every group creates their own processes and bes practices 
- When the interviewer says "what else"typically means she is expecting something more 

## Customer Obsession 
- Every decision of consequence involves the customer
- Optimise for customer experience over profits 
- Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think about solving their needs, not just tasks.
- **TBD** - Come up with a story 

## Ownership 
- Leaders are owners. 
- They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
- They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”
- You can be confident that you’ll be asked questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner.
- **TBD** Come up with a story
