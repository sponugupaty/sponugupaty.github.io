1. TOC
{:toc}

## Basic setup

- Amazon looks for a combination of functional and leadership skills 
- Not much is consistent across groups at Amazon and hence they are guided by leadership principles
- Every group creates their own processes and bes practices 
- When the interviewer says "what else"typically means she is expecting something more 

## Customer Obsession 
- Every decision of consequence involves the customer
- Optimise for customer experience over profits 
- Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think about solving their needs, not just tasks.
- **TBD** - Come up with a story 

## Ownership 
- Leaders are owners. 
- They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
- They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”
- You can be confident that you’ll be asked questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner.
- **TBD** Come up with a story 

## Invent And Simplify 
- Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
- They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. 
- As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time
- **There is always another solution**
- Other key half is simplification 
- **Simpler solutions are cheapest to build , easier to maintain and iterate on**
- Dont shy away from showing the removal of a process 
- Simplicity allows for faster and cheaper innovation 
- Removal is always a better option, when it comes to code, systems, and processes
- **TBD** Come up with a story 

## Are Right a Lot 
- we need them to both have good judgment/instincts, as well as question their own decisions and be open to counter opinions
- Love people with good instincts but need people to being wrong 
- Every perspective and opinion needs to be respected 
- Gives you a chance to re-examine your viewpoint 

## Learn & Be Curious 
- Need you to be open and interested in new things

## Hire and Develop The best 
- Spending time on top performers is one of the best uses of any leaders time 
- Ensuring the growth of people who work with/for you is critical 

## Insist on Highest standards 
- Leaders drive their teams to deliver higher quality products , services and processes 
- Leaders insist on standards which are so high that others including themselves struggle to meet
- Care about fixing the root causes
