# Amazon Leadership Principles

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Basic setup

- Amazon looks for a combination of functional and leadership skills 
- Not much is consistent across groups at Amazon and hence they are guided by leadership principles
- Every group creates their own processes and bes practices 
- When the interviewer says "what else"typically means she is expecting something more 

## Customer Obsession 
- Every decision of consequence involves the customer
- Optimise for customer experience over profits 
- Preferably youâ€™ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think about solving their needs, not just tasks.
- **TBD** - Come up with a story
