# Amazon Leadership Principles

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Basic setup

- Amazon looks for a combination of functional and leadership skills 
- Not much is consistent across groups at Amazon and hence they are guided by leadership principles
- Every group creates their own processes and bes practices 
- When the interviewer says "what else"typically means she is expecting something more 

## Customer Obsession 
- Every decision of consequence involves the customer
- Optimise for customer experience over profits 
- Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think about solving their needs, not just tasks.
- **TBD** - Come up with a story 

## Ownership 
- Leaders are owners. 
- They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
- They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”
- You can be confident that you’ll be asked questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner.
- **TBD** Come up with a story 

## Invent And Simplify 
- Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
- They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. 
- As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time
- **There is always another solution**
- Other key half is simplification 
- **Simpler solutions are cheapest to build , easier to maintain and iterate on**
- Dont shy away from showing the removal of a process 
- Simplicity allows for faster and cheaper innovation 
- Removal is always a better option, when it comes to code, systems, and processes
- **TBD** Come up with a story 

## Are Right a Lot 
- we need them to both have good judgment/instincts, as well as question their own decisions and be open to counter opinions
- Love people with good instincts but need people to being wrong 
- Every perspective and opinion needs to be respected 
- Gives you a chance to re-examine your viewpoint 

## Learn & Be Curious 
- Need you to be open and interested in new things

## Hire and Develop The best 
- Spending time on top performers is one of the best uses of any leaders time 
- Ensuring the growth of people who work with/for you is critical 

## Insist on Highest standards 
- Leaders drive their teams to deliver higher quality products , services and processes 
- Leaders insist on standards which are so high that others including themselves struggle to meet
- Care about fixing the root causes

## Thinking Big 
- When you’re asked for ideas, you should err on the side of being asked to stop
- explaining constraints to a co-worker is easier than explaining how to invent and think

## Bias for action 
- making some decision is much better than making no decision
- You learn more from doing things rather than surveying , testing or projecting things 
- We want leaders who take action, are bold, are willing to take risks, because they know it’s the right thing to do

## Frugality
- Things never cost what they cost, because we can always do less, do it cheaper, do it slower, do it with lower quality
- When you’re interviewing, we’re looking for you to understand that having not enough time or resources is a fine and expected thing. Having too much to do, and too little time is perfectly ok. Not doing everything you want on a project is healthy, because doing everything you ever wanted to do is inefficient. The last thing on your stack rank will never be done, and we should all be happy with that

## Earn Trust 
- Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully
- Then you failed to influence them
- You failed to notice the mistake fast enough
- We care about long term, not short

## Dive Deep 
- “Trust yet verify” is a favorite phrase at Amazon. We care deeply that leaders keep a careful eye on what they own, and know ways to audit their space. If something doesn’t make sense, our leaders need to have the ability (and interest) to dive in and figure out what’s going on
- We need curious and skeptical leaders.

## Have a backbone ; disagree and commit 
- Data based disagreements are great
- I told you so” is never acceptable. 
- We give data, make decisions, and live with the consequences as a team.
- We need leaders who are able to recognize when disagreements are needed, and when they’re not. 
- What’s worth arguing about, and what’s not. What’s worth escalating, and when it’s time to move on and start delivering.

## Deliver Results 
- Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion
- While it’s reasonable to miss dates (we all do, regularly.. certainly more regularly than hitting dates), we also can’t be comfortable with it.
- Right quality is often less quality than we’d prefer
