## How to Grow as Engineering Manager In 7 Steps 

- Management is made of tactical and strategic work
	- Tactical work is situationally obvious something is needed from you; 
	- This can be regular (e.g., attend staff meetings) or by a certain date 
 	- Strategic work is that which if you fail at defining it, communicating it and having your team execute it, then you will have a miss.
	- a lot of management misses are of untimely communication
- Your fundamental limits are your personal time and your focus. 
	- You don’t fully control them, but they are the only thing you have direct control of
	- most people will only help your vision to the extent that you spend time to influence them
- Any time the organization or anyone in it is negatively impacted or surprised as a result of you or your team’s action or inaction, you have missed
- On misses, you need to recognize you have missed, be accountable to stakeholders for the miss, 
	- spend time and focus on strategic actions to make sure it doesn’t happen again
	- failure as a manager is not the occasional miss. That is expected. 
	- Instead it is repeated misses, because you have not spent enough time and focus on strategy to get ahead of future misses
- The first step of growth as a manager is getting on top of tactical work by either pushing back 
	- Or delegating to a more junior person in the team 
- The second part of growth as a manager is starting to dedicate time and focus on strategy
	- This is nothing more than thinking about the risks ahead, thinking about actions to mitigate, and spending time and focus to ensure that doesn’t happen
	- Not much more than communication, agreement and action amongst all stakeholders, so a lot of the work here is developing communication and accountability systems
- Third area - delegating strategic areas 
	- Continuos supervision 
	- Coaching and audit mechanism to ensure success

## Seven Areas Of Software Management 

- Raise your conciousness level to more longer term strategic concerns 
- addressing these concerns by utilising one's focus and time 

- The 7 major areas of engineering management are -
	- Engineering - How are things built ?
	- Execution - How are things built within time and budget ?
	- Operations - Is the built thing going to keep running ?
	- People - Are people motivated to take part in what is being built ?
	- Product - Are customers satisfied by what is being build ?
	- Partners - Do my partners understand and agree with all the above ?
	- Company - How do I get the company to agree to all of these ?

- Be wary of people who always meet their goals - they have traded unseen and valuable to nominal and rewarded

## Engineering 

- What are the means that engineers in your team use to create work products ?
- Coming from a software developement background , this is the easiest to grok 
- But your job is to ensure that the team uses the right tools and processes to meet the short and long term needs of the business
- this leads to tension along the following dimensions -
	- what do the engineers want - might want status quo or might want to abondon something completely 
	- What does the business want short term - Usually means ignoring anything that doesnt have immediate impact
	- What does the business want long term - stable strong team and ensuring the systems stays simple as it grows 
	- What are the current sunk costs that you have ? Difficult to reconcile with above 
- To understand the current position of the team -
	- Engineering Proccesses - Lang , Style , Reviews , Unit Tests , Integration , Design Reviews
	- Engineering Tools - IDE , Build Tools , Deployment tools 
		- What is being done by team ?
		- What are the org Policies ?
		- What are industry best practices ?
	- Understand teams pain points about the above 
	- Undertand the partner teams pain with the current team 
- Given that these questions are more than a full time role , use the 1:1's to gauge engineers judgement 
- Use them to trim the surface to be able to work with some of the questions 
- 2 ways to drill down to a weighted priotised list of pain points -
	- Drill down on a customer problem till you find the tool or process which might be the ideal place to avoid it 
	- Using a survey 
- To get to the weigted list of actions - 2 ends of the spectrum 
- Compare the benefits of silver bullet options vs the more incremental option 
- If mutliple large changes do pass the cost/benefit analysis -
	- Time and focus limited for you and your team . Implement one large change at a time 
	- Choose the right bullets with large industry and Organisational momentum 
	- Dont jump too close to a good bullet since it might turn out to be bad . 
	- Let others do the early adoption issues 
- Other issue might be inertia in which a viable solution doesnt get the resourcing it needs to succceed.
- And since your time is limited and you lack contiguos time - you need help 
- While Senior Engineers agree that we need to collectively work on making tools and processes better ,
	- they themselves dont want to work on it and they have more important things to work on 
	- part of it is also that they believe these initiatives ( high on toil and low on learning) are not recognised or rewarded
	- Find the tech owner to own this area
