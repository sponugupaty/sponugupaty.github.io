## How to Grow as Engineering Manager In 7 Steps 

- Management is made of tactical and strategic work
	- Tactical work is situationally obvious something is needed from you; 
	- This can be regular (e.g., attend staff meetings) or by a certain date 
 	- Strategic work is that which if you fail at defining it, communicating it and having your team execute it, then you will have a miss.
	- a lot of management misses are of untimely communication
- Your fundamental limits are your personal time and your focus. 
	- You don’t fully control them, but they are the only thing you have direct control of
	- most people will only help your vision to the extent that you spend time to influence them
- Any time the organization or anyone in it is negatively impacted or surprised as a result of you or your team’s action or inaction, you have missed
- On misses, you need to recognize you have missed, be accountable to stakeholders for the miss, 
	- spend time and focus on strategic actions to make sure it doesn’t happen again
	- failure as a manager is not the occasional miss. That is expected. 
	- Instead it is repeated misses, because you have not spent enough time and focus on strategy to get ahead of future misses
- The first step of growth as a manager is getting on top of tactical work by either pushing back 
	- Or delegating to a more junior person in the team 
- The second part of growth as a manager is starting to dedicate time and focus on strategy
	- This is nothing more than thinking about the risks ahead, thinking about actions to mitigate, and spending time and focus to ensure that doesn’t happen
	- Not much more than communication, agreement and action amongst all stakeholders, so a lot of the work here is developing communication and accountability systems
- Third area - delegating strategic areas 
	- Continuos supervision 
	- Coaching and audit mechanism to ensure success

## Seven Areas Of Software Management 

- Raise your conciousness level to more longer term strategic concerns 
- addressing these concerns by utilising one's focus and time 

- The 7 major areas of engineering management are -
	- Engineering - How are things built ?
	- Execution - How are things built within time and budget ?
	- Operations - Is the built thing going to keep running ?
	- People - Are people motivated to take part in what is being built ?
	- Product - Are customers satisfied by what is being build ?
	- Partners - Do my partners understand and agree with all the above ?
	- Company - How do I get the company to agree to all of these ?

- Be wary of people who always meet their goals - they have traded unseen and valuable to nominal and rewarded
