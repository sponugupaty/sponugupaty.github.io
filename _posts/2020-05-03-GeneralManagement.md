## How to Grow as Engineering Manager In 7 Steps 

- Management is made of tactical and strategic work
	- Tactical work is situationally obvious something is needed from you; 
	- This can be regular (e.g., attend staff meetings) or by a certain date 
 	- Strategic work is that which if you fail at defining it, communicating it and having your team execute it, then you will have a miss.
	- a lot of management misses are of untimely communication
- Your fundamental limits are your personal time and your focus. 
	- You don’t fully control them, but they are the only thing you have direct control of
	- most people will only help your vision to the extent that you spend time to influence them
- Any time the organization or anyone in it is negatively impacted or surprised as a result of you or your team’s action or inaction, you have missed
- On misses, you need to recognize you have missed, be accountable to stakeholders for the miss, 
	- spend time and focus on strategic actions to make sure it doesn’t happen again
	- failure as a manager is not the occasional miss. That is expected. 
	- Instead it is repeated misses, because you have not spent enough time and focus on strategy to get ahead of future misses
- The first step of growth as a manager is getting on top of tactical work by either pushing back 
	- Or delegating to a more junior person in the team 
- The second part of growth as a manager is starting to dedicate time and focus on strategy
	- This is nothing more than thinking about the risks ahead, thinking about actions to mitigate, and spending time and focus to ensure that doesn’t happen
	- Not much more than communication, agreement and action amongst all stakeholders, so a lot of the work here is developing communication and accountability systems
- Third area - delegating strategic areas 
	- Continuos supervision 
	- Coaching and audit mechanism to ensure success

## Seven Areas Of Software Management 

- Raise your conciousness level to more longer term strategic concerns 
- addressing these concerns by utilising one's focus and time 

- The 7 major areas of engineering management are -
	- Engineering - How are things built ?
	- Execution - How are things built within time and budget ?
	- Operations - Is the built thing going to keep running ?
	- People - Are people motivated to take part in what is being built ?
	- Product - Are customers satisfied by what is being build ?
	- Partners - Do my partners understand and agree with all the above ?
	- Company - How do I get the company to agree to all of these ?

- Be wary of people who always meet their goals - they have traded unseen and valuable to nominal and rewarded

## Engineering 

- What are the means that engineers in your team use to create work products ?
- Coming from a software developement background , this is the easiest to grok 
- But your job is to ensure that the team uses the right tools and processes to meet the short and long term needs of the business
- this leads to tension along the following dimensions -
	- what do the engineers want - might want status quo or might want to abondon something completely 
	- What does the business want short term - Usually means ignoring anything that doesnt have immediate impact
	- What does the business want long term - stable strong team and ensuring the systems stays simple as it grows 
	- What are the current sunk costs that you have ? Difficult to reconcile with above 
- To understand the current position of the team -
	- Engineering Proccesses - Lang , Style , Reviews , Unit Tests , Integration , Design Reviews
	- Engineering Tools - IDE , Build Tools , Deployment tools 
		- What is being done by team ?
		- What are the org Policies ?
		- What are industry best practices ?
	- Understand teams pain points about the above 
	- Undertand the partner teams pain with the current team 
- Given that these questions are more than a full time role , use the 1:1's to gauge engineers judgement 
- Use them to trim the surface to be able to work with some of the questions 
- 2 ways to drill down to a weighted priotised list of pain points -
	- Drill down on a customer problem till you find the tool or process which might be the ideal place to avoid it 
	- Using a survey 
- To get to the weigted list of actions - 2 ends of the spectrum 
- Compare the benefits of silver bullet options vs the more incremental option 
- If mutliple large changes do pass the cost/benefit analysis -
	- Time and focus limited for you and your team . Implement one large change at a time 
	- Choose the right bullets with large industry and Organisational momentum 
	- Dont jump too close to a good bullet since it might turn out to be bad . 
	- Let others do the early adoption issues 
- Other issue might be inertia in which a viable solution doesnt get the resourcing it needs to succceed.
- And since your time is limited and you lack contiguos time - you need help 
- While Senior Engineers agree that we need to collectively work on making tools and processes better ,
	- they themselves dont want to work on it and they have more important things to work on 
	- part of it is also that they believe these initiatives ( high on toil and low on learning) are not recognised or rewarded
	- Find the tech owner to own this area

## Execution 
- Primary goal is to have a group of people to co-ordinate to execute and deliver
- Project Management - managing Individuals to deliver a single goal
- Process Management - managing what team members are working on since they are asked to work on multiple priorities

- Project manage to deliver a goal and process manage to simuleneously deliver multiple goals
- Understand the current state Process -
	- Do you have full list of projects and goals that the team needs to deliver
	- Do you understand the relative priority 
	- Are you overcommited / Capacity planning 
	- How well is team executing on commitments ?
	- Are internal team members happy ?
	- Are partners , management and customers happy ?
- To understand the current projects -
	- Is there a clear project owner ?
	- Are there clear deadlines ?
	- what buffers do you have ? Do mgmt and partners understand the risks ?

- A large amount of the the tension in organizations is disagreements on the absolute priorities of projects
	- However this gets stated by stakeholders frustration at execution rate on their favored projects
- Key areas of project and process management are -
	- Prioritization: Ensuring teams are working on the most important things
	- Throughput: Optimizing the delivery pipeline; minimizing throw-away and duplicated work
	- Risk: minimizing variability on quality and time of delivery
	- Agility: Delivering high-value work earlier to get feedback to allow course correction. This allows risk taking innovation while avoiding rabbit holes.
	- Communication: Maximizing information and minimizing overhead in coordination and collaboration of everyone doing the work
	- Commitment: solving collective action problems across partners on implementation tradeoffs impacting them differently
	- Visibility: Providing management with visibility into delivery state, and so allowing escalation to resolve roadblocks and other challenges
	- Feedback: Creating information to improve quality of future execution
- The biggest problems in execution are not usually a team not working hard on important things, 
- Rather it’s lack of communication about the tradeoffs in priorities on what the team chooses to work on
- owning the narrative
	- You need to have a strategy
	- You need to communicate that strategy
	- You need to be seen to deliver on your strategy
- Saying No with data -  Just saying “no” means you will be seen an obstructionist, so you need to ask for the priority
- Others often have a lot less context on your roadmaps priorities and tradeoffs than you do
- And thus being strategic is spending the time and focus ahead of time, gathering the data in a manner you can reuse when these questions come up
- Delegating with supervision is an additional notion that comes from Andy Grove with the key aspect that you have some aspect of supervision to help the delegate succeed
- Delegation Framework -
	- A goal
	- Identification of stakeholder 
	- recognition of clear owner
	- Criteria for success/failure on an ongoing basis
	- Communication agreement with stakeholders that facilitates coordination towards a goal
- You need to ask your senior engineers to own a certain part of the tactical stuff

## Operations 
- If you ship something that is underspecified - you will end up in operational hell 
- The entire team will be busy in doing hands-on fire fighting and no time to have permanent fixes 
- Preventing this is an issue since shipping features and winning customers more visible 
- If the same team maintains the system in prod , one of the key issues is over reliance on the engineers with deep expertise
- A few basic measures to keep track -
	- How many times were engineers called / paged ?
	- toil - amount of operational work that needs to be done but noone enjoys
	- risk backlog - actionable items 
		- mantain an impact / likelihood and effort needed 
	- availability and performance SLO's
	- weekly operational reviews
