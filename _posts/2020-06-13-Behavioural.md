  - Did you take responsibility ?
  - what did you learn ?
  - how did you recover ?
 - Lead engineer quit close to a release 
 - Had written ~60% of the code with no unit tests and shallow regression tests 
 - Handed it over to a strong mid level engineer but lots of code defects founds in production 
 - Took away a lot of time away from the next release work happening 
 - Didnt ask myself - with the lead engineer leaving how do i accomodate the tech debt and have proper handover sessions ?

## Tell me a situation when you had to solve a difficult problem

 - another team makes a request from yours, you need to be clear about what you can reasonably do

 - Which elements of your plan are most likely to turn them off or produce the most friction? How will you address that?
 
## Talk about a project that you took with ambiguity 
 - Testing assumptions and learning by doing

 - documenting our understanding and asking them to validate was partially successful 
 - light weight prototypes / working code helped resolve the issues 
 
 ## Disagreeing with boss 
 - Contract for candor upfront.
 - hold a separate conversation when the stakes are low and emotions are calm to agree with the boss about how to manage those moments

 - Show respect before dissent
 - Ask for — and earn — permission to disagree.
