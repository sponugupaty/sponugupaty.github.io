## Overview

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Memcache

**What is Memcache ?**
	• In-memory key value data store
	• Faster than the disk based caches 
	• Can put anything that is serializable as either keys or values
**What is Memcache useful for ?**
	• Caching
		○ Data store query results 
		○ User authentication or session data 
		○ API calls or other computation results 
	• Sharing data across app instances 
**Why do we need Memcache ?**
	• Improve Application performance
		○ Faster than datastore  
	• Reduce application cost 
**How do we use Memcache ?**
	• Usage Pattern -
		○ Co-ordinate data read with data store -
			§ Check if memcache value exists - if yes - show directly 
			§ If does not - fetch from data store and write value to memcache 
		○ Co-ordinate data write with data store -
			§ Invalidate the entire cache or particular entry 
			§ Write to data store 
			§ Optionally update memcache entry 
**Caveats of Memcache -**
	• It is volatile -
		○ Entry has reached expiration 
		○ Memcache is full 
		○ Memcache server fails 
		○ Solution : Implement write-through logic to data store
	• It is not transactional -
		○ Causing inconsistency in data 
		○ Solution : Use optimistic locking
	• It is a limited resource 
**Memcache vs Redis comparison:**
	• Both can perform the same functions 
	• Read/Write speed : Redis faster 
	• Memory Usage : Redis is better 
	• Disk I/O Dumping : Redis
	• Memcache Value to be stored limited to 1MB . Redis 512MB
	• Memcache looses data on restart . Redis can retain data 
	• Redis comes with cluster support 
	• Redis has support for many data types whereas memcache is primarily strings
