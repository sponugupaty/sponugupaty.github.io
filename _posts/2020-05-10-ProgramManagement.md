## Define and develop roadmaps
  - Roadmaps are a tool to think beyond the next few sprints
  - they help us to plan , communicate and to get buy in 
  - this would also mean that the teams are aligned , can focus on executio and hit long term goals
  - key sections of a roadmap document which can vary from 3-12 months plan 
    - Primary focus 
    - Deliverables 
    - Out Of Scope 
    - known risks
    - request to other teams 
    - current status 
   - Why create a product roadmap?
      - Lead → set clear goals for the org to get behind.
      - Plan → enumerate deliverables and timelines to achieve those goals.
      - Communicate → get buy in, set accountability, and align the org.
      - Deliver → create a reliable cadence for shipping, build confidence
   - How do I go about writing a quarterly roadmap?
    - Gather ideas 
    - Write broad roapmap 
    - Meeting with Engineering
    - Meeting with stakeholders 
    - Get Signoff

## Managing multiple projects 
  - Make ure plan , process and responsibilities are clear 
  - Make sure goals , schedules and who is responsible is clear
  - Ensuring that templates are clear for each of the projects leads 
  - priorotise projects based on impacts 
  - look at work across projects to balance orkloads and timelines
  - Adjust schedules to maximise team productivity 
    - stagger start dates for similar projects 
    - flag duplicates 
    - look for dependencies

## Understand customer needs 
  - One of the most famous frameworks is "Jobs To Be Done"framework 
  - What job is your product hired to do ?
  - Which progress is the customer trying to make in a given circumstance 
  - To inovate - start with customer struggle and not need 
  - Since the need is always archetyped on the existing world 
  - Minimize ( direction) + {the time OR the likelihood} ( metric) + object of control + [optional contextual clarifier].

## Define clear projects plans 



## Scoping Projects
- Scoping isnt something that you think about for 1 day and never think about it 
- You need to pay attention to scoping throughtout the project 
- Planning Phase : Early stages of defining the project and its goals 
- Scoping Phase : Where you plan for and estimate all the work that needs to happen 
- Execution Phase : where the works gets done 
- Details of **Planning Phase** 
  - Define very specific goals for the project which helps control feature creep
  - Explicitly defining anti-goals also helps ( todo : **Examples**)
  - dividing the scope into must-haves and nice to haves is also a good way 
  - Minimise the batch size of the project 
    - Having clear milestones and checkpoints in the project 
    - Making it launching only part of the project easy 
  - De-Risk the project as soon as possible 
    - Tackling the riskiest part of the project first 
    - Prototying the riskiest parts of the project first 
    - Typically external subsystems add the most risk to a project
  - Optimise for the total impact rather than amount of work done 
  - Avoid re-write of a system 
    - We tend to undeestimate the amount of time taken 
    - Tempted to add new features and improvements 
    - Build an overly complicated system since we are overly focused on the shortcomings of the first system
  - Details of **Scoping Phase**
    - Only engineers working on the code should scope 
    - Dont underestimate amount of work needed 
    - Divide the project into smaller tasks <5 days ideally 
    - Define measureable goals to get to the project milestones 
    - Think of project estimates as probability estimates . 50% chance we will be done in 4 weeks and 90% in 8 weeks
    - Use historical data 
    - timebox open ended questions of the project 
    - Add Buffer 
  - Execution Phase 
    - Re-scope regularly based on the planned vs actual time taken 
    - Use milestones to answer the question - Hows the project going 
    - If project slips , ensure that everyone understands why the project slipped 
      - Prepare a revised and realistic plan of the project plan
