## Business Model 
- Understanding the 'flywheel' business model represents how the company operates at all levels 
- Below are the components of the business model 
- **Selection** - products and services under various categories is nearly infinite
- **Sellers** - Many third party sellers on the platform who can sell 
- **Customer Experience** - They use the metric of "Lifetime Customer Value"
  - LCV = (Avg value of sale ) * ( Number of repeat transactions ) * (Avg retention time in months )
- **Lower Cost Structure** - No brick or mortar business 
- **Lower Prices** - Customers will always want lower prices. 'Timeless truth'
- **Traffic** - Number of visitors to their website 
- Every component is an accelerator . Even if one of the components moves, the other one moves as well 
- Focus is on long term growth vs short term profits

## Understanding Amazon A Little Further 
- Amazon discloses revenue in three segments - Media, Electronics & General Merchandise (‘EGM') and ‘Other’
- Óther is mostly AWS
- Amazon is in fact organized not just in these segments, but in dozens and dozens of separate teams, each with their own internal P&L     and a high degree of autonomy. So, say, shoes in Germany, electronics in France or makeup in the USA are all different teams. Each of   these businesses, incidentally, sets its own prices.
- Meanwhile, all of these businesses are at different stages of maturity. Some are relatively old, and well established, and growing       slower, and are profitable. Others are new startups building their business and losing money as they do so, like any other new           business. Some are very profitable, and some sell at cost or at as loss-leaders to drive traffic and loyalty to the site
- Amazon’s business is delivering very rapid revenue growth but not accumulating any surplus cash or profits, because every penny of       cash is being ploughed back into expanding the business further
- Amazon has perhaps 1% of the US retail market by value. Should it stop entering new categories and markets and instead take profit, and by extension leave those segments and markets for other companies? Or should it keep investing to sweep them into the platform?
