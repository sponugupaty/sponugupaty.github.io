# Amazon : Leadership Principles

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Basic setup

- Amazon looks for a combination of functional and leadership skills 
- Not much is consistent across groups at Amazon and hence they are guided by leadership principles
- Every group creates their own processes and bes practices 
- When the interviewer says "what else"typically means she is expecting something more 

## Customer Obsession 
- Every decision of consequence involves the customer
- Optimise for customer experience over profits 
- Preferably you’ll know who your customer is, their needs, what they really want from you (outside of your specific tasks), and think     about solving their needs, not just tasks.
- How to make it better , faster , cheaper for the customer
- Q: Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
- **Story**
- **Story 1** 
  - Drama 
    - Implementation of a Master Data Management project for a state Justice department 
    - Studied the typical downsides of MDM initiaves and concluded that we needed to be more agile 
    - Govt agency not familiar with Agile practices and had a healthy dose of aprehension in adopting Agile 
  - Alternate 
    - One of the alternate approaches was to direct the organisation to an external Agile vendor to train employees
    - Slow process and no guaranteed interest 
  - What Did I do ?
    - Proposed a series of lucn brown bags to start talking about Agile 
    - Started with first priciples of user stories and standups 
    - Added layers of complexity as went about it 
  - Results 
    - Were able to demonstrate working software to a few departments in 3 months time 
    - Got better buy-in from the other departments and ultimately helped the project to be a success
 - **Story 2**
  - Drama 
    - **TODO**

## Ownership 
- Leaders are owners. 
- They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
- They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”
- You can be confident that you’ll be asked questions to assess if you can act and think as an owner.
- Q: Give me an example of when you took a risk and failed.
- **Story 1**
- Drama 
  - Me and my team were working on a reporting project in compressed timeframes 
  - Shortly after the initiation of the project , the main stakeholder had to leave due to personal emergency
  - Prior to her leaving , we had planned demo with a large audience within her group
- Alternate 
  - Should have moved or cancelled the existing invite given the absence of the main stakeholder 
  - I was comfortable that we understood the requiremeents well enough to develop and show case the reports
- What did I do ?
  - Instead of moving the demo with the larger audience , should have taken the time to spend iniitial time with the main stakeholder
  - And get their buy-in
- Results 
  - 20 mins into the demo , it was clear that what we had built did not meet the primary goals of the project
  - Apologised to the audience and took corrective steps 
  - Led to about 2 weeks of rework and loss of face 
- **Story 2**
- Drama 
  - Last miniute defect meant that the sequencing of the existing deployment steps would fail
  - We needed to make changes to the deployment steps 
  - It was already published to the release team 
- Alternates
  - Had a verbal chat with the release co-ordinator and updated 
- What did I do ?
  - I should have checked the release notes to ensure that they indeed have been updated
- Results 
  - Deployment during production lodgement failed 
  - Responded with a lightweight process to ensure atleast one engineer signs off on the deployment 
    
## Invent And Simplify 
- Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
- They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. 
- As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time
- **There is always another solution**
- Other key half is simplification 
- **Simpler solutions are cheapest to build , easier to maintain and iterate on**
- Dont shy away from showing the removal of a process 
- Simplicity allows for faster and cheaper innovation 
- Removal is always a better option, when it comes to code, systems, and processes
- **Story 1**
  - Drama 
    - Adjacent teams writing redundant code for same basic functionality 
    - UI validations etc and were being challenged on the high cost of estimates due to the dev and test times
    - The pattern of defects was the same across releases
    - Each team focused on their own deliverables without much thought to development of reusable components 
   - Alternate 
    - Was to accept the status quo and agree that thats how the projects would run 
    - Leading to engineers wasting a lot of time in writing boiler plate code 
   - What did I do ?
    - Proposed a search engine for code to be indexed and easily searched 
   - Results
    - Looked at Lucene and simple SQL Text search indexing options and went with the simpler option
    - Since the reusable code was tested and in majority of the cases , in production after testing 
    - Meant the bugs count came down . The overall Dev and Test costs also were reduced by 10-20%
 - **Story 2**
  - Drama 
    - **To do**

## Are Right a Lot 
- we need them to both have good judgment/instincts, as well as question their own decisions and be open to counter opinions
- Love people with good instincts but need people to being wrong 
- Every perspective and opinion needs to be respected 
- Gives you a chance to re-examine your viewpoint 

## Learn & Be Curious 
- Need you to be open and interested in new things

## Hire and Develop The best 
- Spending time on top performers is one of the best uses of any leaders time 
- Ensuring the growth of people who work with/for you is critical
- **Story 1**
  - Drama 
    - Lead Engineer in current team bored and felt was not being intellectually challenged 
    - Was aiming for a role with borader impact
    - Had limited organisational outreach due to a variety of factors 
  - Alternate 
    - Would have quit in short to medium term if these needs were not met 
  - What did I do ?
    - Connected him with a few adjacent teams and encouraged him to explore the work these teams were doing
    - Facilitated that he be invited to solution design sessions within those teams 
    - Ensured that he was attending forums with the adjacent teams in attendance 
  - Results 
    - A few months back , he found a role within another team 
    - Excited about the technology stack and the work he is doing and impact  
    - On his way to a very successful stint with this team 
 - **Story 2 **
  - Drama 
    - Introverted engineer on team with a wide area of experience and expertise 
    - Was doing OK but I felt he could contribute more 
    - Very detail oriented and loved sharing his experiences 
  - Alternate 
    - Being close to his retirement , he would have probably continued in the current fashion 
  - What did I do ?
    - Assigned him a small project with a clear mandate to lead the small team 
    - Gave him the flexibility to choose the team members he wanted to work on his project 
    - Helped him with the light weight agile processes we follow in the team 
    - Made him comfortable 
  - Results 
    - After 6-8 months , he is now directly responsible individual for this single threaded project 
    - Has won multiple accolades from the business for helping them with major workflow tradeoffs
  
    

## Insist on Highest standards 
- Leaders drive their teams to deliver higher quality products , services and processes 
- Leaders insist on standards which are so high that others including themselves struggle to meet
- Care about fixing the root causes

## Thinking Big 
- When you’re asked for ideas, you should err on the side of being asked to stop
- explaining constraints to a co-worker is easier than explaining how to invent and think

## Bias for action 
- making some decision is much better than making no decision
- You learn more from doing things rather than surveying , testing or projecting things 
- We want leaders who take action, are bold, are willing to take risks, because they know it’s the right thing to do

## Frugality
- Things never cost what they cost, because we can always do less, do it cheaper, do it slower, do it with lower quality
- When you’re interviewing, we’re looking for you to understand that having not enough time or resources is a fine and expected thing. Having too much to do, and too little time is perfectly ok. Not doing everything you want on a project is healthy, because doing everything you ever wanted to do is inefficient. The last thing on your stack rank will never be done, and we should all be happy with that
- **Story 1**
  - Drama 
    - Could  not hire engineers fast enough to meet all the expected business outcomes
    - Perenially short of capacity to priority 2 and 3 user needs 
  - Alternates     
    - The product vendor services costs did not make it a really feasible option 
    - The ramp up time for anyone coming from outside market too steep to be useful in 3 months time
  - What did I do ?
    - Worked with the offshore vendor to design an onboarding experience for Manual Testers for Dev Skills
    - After a 45 day immersive experiece , the test team members were ready to join the development team 
  - Results 
    - No dedicated test team . Rather the team comprised of engineers and former test only engineers
    - Engineers cross skilled in development and system testing and team responsible for system testing 
    - Saved $$ on external hires / Product Vendors and also gave a boost to individuals future prospects 
    
    

## Earn Trust 
- Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully
- Then you failed to influence them
- You failed to notice the mistake fast enough
- We care about long term, not short

## Dive Deep 
- “Trust yet verify” is a favorite phrase at Amazon. We care deeply that leaders keep a careful eye on what they own, and know ways to audit their space. If something doesn’t make sense, our leaders need to have the ability (and interest) to dive in and figure out what’s going on
- We need curious and skeptical leaders.

## Have a backbone ; disagree and commit 
- Data based disagreements are great
- I told you so” is never acceptable. 
- We give data, make decisions, and live with the consequences as a team.
- We need leaders who are able to recognize when disagreements are needed, and when they’re not. 
- What’s worth arguing about, and what’s not. What’s worth escalating, and when it’s time to move on and start delivering.

## Deliver Results 
- Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion
- While it’s reasonable to miss dates (we all do, regularly.. certainly more regularly than hitting dates), we also can’t be comfortable with it.
- Right quality is often less quality than we’d prefer
