## Fundamentals - Mixu ( 4 Hours )
[This](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/ebook.html) is an assessible introduction to distributed systems . This is also a quick read of about 70 pages . 

Key notes -
- The core of distributed programming is dealing with distance and having more than one thing
- Distributed computing is art of solving the same problem that you can solve on a single machine using multiple machines
- This is usuallly because the problem doesnt fit on a single machine 
- Nothing really demands that you use distributed computing
- At a small scale , hardware update is a viable strategy. However at large scale - impossible or cost prohibitive
- High end software is only helpful when it is able to replace slow network accesses with internal memory access
- The advantage of high end software is only when there is large amount of communication among nodes
- Ideally adding a machine should scale a system linearly - but overhead of data to be copied & co-ordination of tasks
- Everything starts with a need to deal with size
