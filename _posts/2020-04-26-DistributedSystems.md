## Fundamentals - Mixu ( 4 Hours )
[This](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/ebook.html) is an assessible introduction to distributed systems . This is also a quick read of about 70 pages . 

Key notes -
- The core of distributed programming is dealing with distance and having more than one thing
- Distributed computing is art of solving the same problem that you can solve on a single machine using multiple machines
- This is usuallly because the problem doesnt fit on a single machine 
- Nothing really demands that you use distributed computing
- At a small scale , hardware update is a viable strategy. However at large scale - impossible or cost prohibitive
- High end software is only helpful when it is able to replace slow network accesses with internal memory access
- The advantage of high end software is only when there is large amount of communication among nodes
- Ideally adding a machine should scale a system linearly - but overhead of data to be copied & co-ordination of tasks
- Everything starts with a need to deal with size 
- *Scalability* is the ability of a system , process or network to handle growing amount of work
- Or its ability to be enlarged to accomodate that growth
- 3 Types of scalability 
- Size Scalability - adding nodes makes system linearly faster ; growing dataset doesnt increase latency
- Geographic Scalability - Possible to use multiple datacenters to reduce time to respond to queries . 
- Handle the cross data center latency in a sensible manner 
- administrative scalability - adding nodes doesnt increase the administrative costs of system 
- A scalable system meets the peformane and avalability needs of its users
